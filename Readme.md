# üéÑ Advent of Code üéÑ

Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge where participants solve daily coding puzzles throughout the month of December. Each day brings a new problem that tests various programming and problem-solving skills.

## Years and Stars (68‚≠ê)
Here is a list of the years I have competed in and the stars I've earned:

- [**2022**](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2022/2022%20README.md) **=> 14‚≠ê**
- [**2023**](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2023/2023%20README.md) **=> 50‚≠ê (AoC++)**
- [**2024**](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2024/2024%20README.md) **=> 4‚≠ê (AoC++)**

Feel free to explore the solutions and share your thoughts. Happy coding and may the stars be with you!

## Contribution Notice

Thank you for your interest in this Advent of Code repository. This project was undertaken independently, and the code reflects the solutions as they were at the time of completion. While I appreciate the enthusiasm to contribute and optimize, I would like to maintain this repository as a personal showcase of my progress and coding style during the challenges.

Feel free to explore and gain insights, but I kindly request that you refrain from submitting contributions or pull requests. If you have questions or suggestions, I'd be happy to discuss them through other means mentioned in the "Contact" section.

Thank you for your understanding!
